## A no-good python calculator written in python using the time & math library. 

Its current operations are limited. 
***It will  most likely not be updated in the future!*** 

These operations are:
* Addition
* Subtraction
* Multiplacation
* Division
* Exponents
* Square roots
* Pythagorean Theorum
* Quitting (stopping the function `my_calculator`)
* Clearing the command line (*this only works on repl*)

I constantly am refrencing a Repl.it project that I originally created this in, which can be found [here](https://repl.it/@GrantGarton/No-Good-Python-Calculator)

As said above, this will *probably* not be updated in the future because nobody will use this or look at it, and it's not that I *would* update this if it was used, it's just not fun to work on and I'd like to do other things. Please be advised, this is not a good calculator 

***You have been warned***
